# hello-world
My introductory repository, for storing random things that don't go anywhere else.

My name is Chris Wenzlick, and I am an aspiring game developer. I created this GitHub account as a means of storing and tracking my personal projects, as well as collaborating with others. This hello-world repository will serve as a sort of filedump for anything which I feel does not require a dedicated repository.
